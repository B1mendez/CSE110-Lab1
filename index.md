<h2>Welcome to my Github! I'm Brian</h2>

### About Me

I am a student at UC San Diego majoring in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** and have recently launched my tutoring company called [Better Times Tutoring](https://bettertimestutoring.com).\
To briefly sum up my goals, I would say I've transfered a big portion of my time on self improvement and while this may sound generic it can be understood by one of my favorite quotes stated as 
> Be willing to be uncomfortable. Be comfortable being uncomfortable. It may get tough, but it's a small price to pay for living a dream.

### Personal Hobbies and Interests: 

- Playing the guitar
- Salt and Fresh water fishing
- Strength Training 
- Cooking specifically dinner oriented dishes 
- Reading specifically about entrepreneurship, finance, technology, and self improvement
